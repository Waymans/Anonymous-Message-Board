# Anonymous Message Board(AMB)

## What is it?
AMB is a message board where a user can create threads and reply anonymously. Others can view, reply to, and report threads or replies.

### Stack
AMB is made with the following:
> ##### Back End:
> * Express
> * Mongoose
> ##### Front End:
> * jQuery

### User Stories

*I originally passed all of these user stories in order to complete a challenge but have since updated the app more for design purposes.
Most of them are still followed except for the need of inputing thread/reply_id's.

<ol>

  <li>I can <b>POST</b> a thread to a specific message board by passing form data <code>text</code> and <code>delete_password</code> to <i>/api/threads/{board}</i>.(Recomend res.redirect to board page /b/{board})
    Saved will be <code>_id</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>created_on</code>(date&amp;time), <code>bumped_on</code>(date&amp;time, starts same as created_on), <code>reported</code>(boolean), <code>delete_password</code>, &amp; <code>replies</code>(array).</li>
  <li>I can <b>POST</b> a reply to a thread on a specific board by passing form data <code>text</code>, <code>delete_password</code>, &amp; <code>thread_id</code> to <i>/api/replies/{board}</i> and it will also update the bumped_on date to the comments date.(Recomend res.redirect to thread page /b/{board}/{thread_id})
